Additional variables included in the ACS are Net and Gross Capital Stock, Consumption of Fixed Capital, the Agriculture Investment ratio, and the Gross Fixed Capital Formation Agriculture Orientation Index.   The FAO Agriculture Capital Stock Database is an analytical database: whenever available, the database integrates official National Accounts data harvested from the UNSD National Accounts Main Aggregates Database (UNSD AMA) and the OECD Annual National Accounts Database (OECD ANA). If the full set of official data is not available for any specific country, imputation methods are applied to obtain estimates over the complete time series. Many data points in ACS are estimated and are flagged as such; they do not represent official Member countries' submissions.  With a view of producing internationally comparable net capital stock estimates, we employ the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) with a time invariant geometric depreciation rate to impute missing data. The Perpetual Inventory Method is a well-established economic model to calculate Net Capital Stocks (NCS) and Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC) from time series of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Specifically, annual measures of the NCS are obtained from cumulating historical series on physical investment flows and deducting the part of assets that are depreciated (the Consumption of Fixed Capital that occurs in every period).   In order to implement the PIM, long time series on aggregate GFCF in agriculture, forestry and fishing is required. As much as possible, we rely on National Accounts data published by the OECD and UNSD. When country data are partially or fully missing, we employ econometric techniques to impute missing observations. Depending on the pattern of data missingness for the countries, different imputation methods are applied (selected from the ARMAX, PANEL and OLS classes of econometric models). Working with the above-mentioned data sources, we can rely on country data - though very incomplete in some cases - on agriculture GFCF, CFC and/or NCS for 103 countries to guide us in our data gap filling exercise. For the other 104 countries included in the database, we fully rely on imputation methods. For a detailed description of the imputation methods and our PIM framework, refer to box 20.5.   All data series in the database are provided both in national currencies and in US dollars as well as in current prices and constant prices with base year 2010. Calculation of constant price series is done applying GFCF deflator series. When OECD National Accounts data are available, an OECD implicit deflator for agriculture GFCF is calculated and used. For other cases, the implicit deflators on GFCF for total economy available from the FAOSTAT Deflators database is used.", "Contact": "Mr. Mukesh Srivastava", "Email": "macrostats@fao.org", "DateUpdate": "2018-09-11", "CompressionFormat": "zip", "FileType": "csv", "FileSize": "582KB", "FileRows": 72838, "FileLocation": "http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Investment_CapitalStock_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}, {"DatasetCode": "EA", "DatasetName": "Investment: Development Flows to Agriculture", "Topic": "Total economy, Agriculture, forestry and fisheries, environmental protection, rural development, and food security assistance/aid.", "DatasetDescription": "Data originates from OECD DAC, and is harvested from the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) database.

Data include the emissions/removals from Agriculture and Land Use from FAOSTAT GHG emissions estimates (2019), while the emissions from all other sectors are from the third-party priority data of the PRIMAP-hist dataset v2.1 (G\u00fctschow et al., 2016; G\u00fctschow et al., 2019).   The domain \u0091Emissions shares\u0092 contains the following data categories available for download by sector: a) country-level emissions in Gg CO2eq; b) shares of total CO2eq emissions; c) country-level emissions of Gg from the single gases \u0096 carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and the aggregate F-gases; and d) shares of total emissions from CO2, CH4, N2O and F-gases.

Data for the sector Agriculture total combines the CH4 and N2O emissions from crop and livestock and other agricultural management activities.  GHG emissions for Food-related land use are those associated with the carbon losses due to forest converted to other land uses (Net forest conversion); the degradation of organic soils used for cultivation and grazing; and the emissions from biomass burnt in humid tropical forests and in organic soils. In addition to these, the Land Use total further includes the CO2 emissions and removals from carbon stock changes in the biomass pools of \u0091Forest land\u0092 and the emissions from the burning of biomass in sub-tropical, temperate and boreal forests.

Data are expressed in terms of area harvested, production quantity and yield. The objective is to comprehensively cover production of all primary crops for all countries and regions in the world.Cereals: Area and production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed or silage or used for grazing are therefore excluded. Area data relate to harvested area. Some countries report sown or cultivated area only; however, in these countries the sown or cultivated area does not differ significantly in normal years from the area actually harvested, either because practically the whole area sown is harvested or because the area surveys are conducted around the harvest period.Vegetables, total (including melons): Data relate to vegetable crops grown mainly for human consumption. Crops such as cabbages, pumpkins and carrots, when explicitly cultivated for animal feed, are therefore excluded. Statistics on vegetables are not available in many countries, and the coverage of the reported data differs from country to country. In general, it appears that the data refer to crops grown in field and market gardens mainly for sale, thus excluding crops cultivated in kitchen gardens or small family gardens mainly for household consumption.Fruit, total (excluding melons): Data refer to total production of fresh fruit, whether finally used for direct consumption for food or feed, or processed into different products: dry fruit, juice, jam, alcohol, etc. Generally, production data relate to plantation crops or orchard crops grown mainly for sale. Data on production from scattered trees used mainly for home consumption are not usually collected. Production from wild plants, particularly berries, which is of some importance in certain countries, is generally disregarded by national statistical services. Therefore, the data for the various fruits and berries are rather incomplete. Bananas and plantains: Figures on bananas refer, as far as possible, to all edible fruit-bearing species of the genus Musa except Musa paradisiaca, commonly known as plantain. Unfortunately, several countries make no distinction in their statistics between bananas and plantains and publish only overall estimates. When this occurs and there is some indication or assumption that the data reported refer mainly to bananas, the data are included. The production data on bananas and plantains reported by the various countries are also difficult to compare because a number of countries report in terms of bunches, which generally means that the stalk is included in the weight. Dates, plantains and total grapes are included in the \u0093total fruit\u0094 aggregated figures, while olives are excluded.
