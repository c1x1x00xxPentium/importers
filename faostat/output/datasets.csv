AE,ASTI R&D Indicators: ASTI-Expenditures,"ASTI collects primary time-series data on agricultural research capacity and spending levels through national survey rounds in over 80 low-and middle-income countries. Data collection is carried out by country focal points, who distribute survey forms to all agencies known to conduct agricultural research in a given country, including government, nonprofit, and higher education agencies. Private-for profit sector coverage is limited, and hence excluded from this dataset. More detailed country- and regional-level data on agricultural research capacity, investment, and outputs are available on www.asti.cgiar.org/data."

BC,Food Balance: Commodity Balances - Crops Primary Equivalent,"Commodity balances show balances of food and agricultural commodities in a standardized form. The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. A number of commodity/item aggregates have been included to offer synthetic information. Some of these are included with the aim of simplifying the extraction of all component commodities. Data shown in the item aggregates represent the sum of the component commodities as presented in this domain (standardized form). Commodity coverage: The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages.  Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent."
BL,Food Balance: Commodity Balances - Livestock and Fish Primary Equivalent,"Food supply data is some of the most important data in FAOSTAT. In fact, this data is for the basis for estimation of global and national undernourishment assessment, when it is combined with parameters and other data sets. This data has been the foundation of food balance sheets ever since they were first constructed. The data is accessed by both business and governments for economic analysis and policy setting, as well as being used by the academic community."

CISP,Investment: Country Investment Statistics Profile,"The Country Investment Statistics Profile domain provides an overall view of the information about investment in agriculture at country level. Data are collected from other FAOSTAT domains, in particular from Investment and Macro Indicators. The purpose is to give to the users a comprehensive dataset that allows making comparison among the different flows to agriculture within each country. The dataset consists of a time series of more than 200 countries, from 2001 onwards. The information included regards the levels of central government expenditure on agriculture, credit to agriculture, official development flows (commitment) and foreign direct investment on agriculture. Besides the levels of investment flows, the dataset also includes the information on agriculture value added and agriculture gross fixed capital formation. Additional reported indicators are -the share of total flow allocated to agriculture (for Government Expenditure on Agriculture, Credit to Agriculture, Development Flows, Foreign direct Investment to Agriculture), -the agriculture share of total GDP, -the agriculture share of total gross fixed capital formation, -the agriculture orientation index (ratio of the agriculture share of total flow, over the agriculture value added share of total GDP) for Government Expenditure on Agriculture, Credit to Agriculture, Development Flows to Agriculture, -the investment agriculture orientation index (which is the ratio between the agriculture share of gross fixed capital formation over the agriculture share of GDP), -the annual growth,-the investment ratio (ratio between gross fixed capital formation over GDP),-the agriculture investment ratio (ratio between agriculture gross fixed capital formation and agriculture value added). Though the goal is to have complete and consistent coverage for all countries, relatively low response rates for the different databases belonging to the investment domain and country level differences in data collection and reporting creates some challenges in providing a complete and consistent global dataset.

CS,Macro-Statistics: Capital Stock,"As part of the FAO Agriculture Capital Stock (ACS) database, ESS-FAO publishes country-by-country data on physical investment in agriculture, forestry and fishing as measured by the System of National Accounts (SNA) concept of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Additional variables included in the ACS are Net and Gross Capital Stock, Consumption of Fixed Capital, the Agriculture Investment ratio, and the Gross Fixed Capital Formation Agriculture Orientation Index.   The FAO Agriculture Capital Stock Database is an analytical database: whenever available, the database integrates official National Accounts data harvested from the UNSD National Accounts Main Aggregates Database (UNSD AMA) and the OECD Annual National Accounts Database (OECD ANA). If the full set of official data is not available for any specific country, imputation methods are applied to obtain estimates over the complete time series. Many data points in ACS are estimated and are flagged as such; they do not represent official Member countries' submissions.  With a view of producing internationally comparable net capital stock estimates, we employ the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) with a time invariant geometric depreciation rate to impute missing data. The Perpetual Inventory Method is a well-established economic model to calculate Net Capital Stocks (NCS) and Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC) from time series of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Specifically, annual measures of the NCS are obtained from cumulating historical series on physical investment flows and deducting the part of assets that are depreciated (the Consumption of Fixed Capital that occurs in every period).   In order to implement the PIM, long time series on aggregate GFCF in agriculture, forestry and fishing is required. As much as possible, we rely on National Accounts data published by the OECD and UNSD. When country data are partially or fully missing, we employ econometric techniques to impute missing observations. Depending on the pattern of data missingness for the countries, different imputation methods are applied (selected from the ARMAX, PANEL and OLS classes of econometric models). Working with the above-mentioned data sources, we can rely on country data - though very incomplete in some cases - on agriculture GFCF, CFC and/or NCS for 103 countries to guide us in our data gap filling exercise. For the other 104 countries included in the database, we fully rely on imputation methods. For a detailed description of the imputation methods and our PIM framework, refer to box 20.5.   All data series in the database are provided both in national currencies and in US dollars as well as in current prices and constant prices with base year 2010. Calculation of constant price series is done applying GFCF deflator series. When OECD National Accounts data are available, an OECD implicit deflator for agriculture GFCF is calculated and used. For other cases, the implicit deflators on GFCF for total economy available from the FAOSTAT Deflators database is used."
EF,Agri-Environmental Indicators: Fertilizers indicators,"The data describe the use of chemical and mineral fertilizers per area of cropland (which corresponds to the sum of arable land and permanent crops) at national, regional, and global level in a time series from 2002 to 2017"
EI,Agri-Environmental Indicators: Emissions intensities,Intensities of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by unit of product for a selection of agricultural commodities.
EK,Agri-Environmental Indicators: Livestock Patterns,"The Livestock Patterns domain of the FAOSTAT Agri-Environmental Indicators contains data on livestock numbers, shares of major livestock species and livestock densities in the agricultural land area. Values are calculated using Livestock Units (LSU), which facilitate aggregating information for different livestock types. Data are available by country, with global coverage, for the period 19612017. This methodology applies the LSU coefficients reported in the ""Guidelines for the preparation of livestock sector reviews"" (FAO, 2011). From this publication, LSU coefficients are computed by livestock type and by country. The reference unit used for the calculation of livestock units (=1 LSU) is the grazing equivalent of one adult dairy cow producing 3000 kg of milk annually, fed without additional concentrated foodstuffs.   FAOSTAT agri-environmental indicators on livestock patterns closely follow the structure of the indicators in EUROSTAT."
EL,Agri-Environmental Indicators: Land use indicators,"The Agri-environmental IndicatorsLand Use domain provides information on the distribution of agricultural and forest land, and their sub-components, including irrigated areas and areas under organic agriculture, at national, regional and global levels."
EM,Agri-Environmental Indicators: Emissions shares,"The FAOSTAT Emissions shares domain of FAOSTAT Agri-Environmental Indicators disseminates data on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions shares of agriculture and related land use to the total emissions from all economic sectors, by gas, country and year, for the period 19902017. Emissions data are also disseminated, for transparency. The economic sectors considered as emission sources are those defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the 2006 guidelines (Vol.1, ch.8): Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use, Waste, and Agriculture. Agriculture-related land use emissions are also considered and used to compute emissions shares. Emissions from agriculture and associated land use are taken from the relevant FAOSTAT GHG emissions domains of Emissions-Agriculture and Emissions-Land Use (2019). Agriculture-related land use emissions include emissions from cropland, grassland, net forest conversion, and fires from burning of organic soils and humid tropical forests. Emissions from the other sectors are taken from the third-party PRIMAP-hist dataset v2.1 (Gütschow et al., 2016; Gütschow et al., 2019).    Shares are computed and disseminated with respect to total CO2eq as well as single gas emissions. Total emissions are computed by summing emissions in CO2 gas with emissions of the other trace gases, the latter converted in CO2eq via Global Warming Potentials (GWP) coefficients. Results are disseminated separately for GWPs corresponding to three different options used in various IPCC reporting processes, namely GWPs from: a) the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR)(IPCC, 1996); b) the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (IPCC, 2007); and c) the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)(IPCC, 2014).  Data are available by country, by FAOSTAT regional aggregation and special group, including the Annex I and Non-Annex I Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).   A complete methodological note is available at: http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/documents/EM/EM_e.pdf"

FBS,Food Balance: New Food Balances,"Food Balance Sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period. The food balance sheet shows for each food item - i.e. each primary commodity and a number of processed commodities potentially available for human consumption - the sources of supply and its utilization. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of it. Data on per caput food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and - by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products - also in terms of caloric value and protein and fat content."

GT,Emissions - Agriculture: Agriculture Total,"Agriculture Total contains all the emissions produced in the different agricultural emissions sub-domains (enteric fermentation, manure management, rice cultivation, synthetic fertilizers, manure applied to soils, manure left on pastures, crop residues, cultivation of organic soils,  burning of crop residues, burning of savanna, energy use), providing a picture of the contribution to the total amount of GHG emissions from agriculture. GHG emissions from agriculture consist of non-CO2 gases, namely methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), produced by crop and livestock production and management activities.  The FAOSTAT emissions database is computed following Tier 1 IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html). GHG emissions are provided by country, regions and special groups, with global coverage, relative to the period 1961-present (with annual updates) and with projections for 2030 and 2050, expressed as Gg CO2 and CO2eq (from CH4 and N2O), by underlying agricultural emission sub-domain and by aggregate (agriculture total, agriculture total plus energy, agricultural soils)."
GU,Emissions - Agriculture: Manure applied to Soils,"GHG emissions from manure applied to soils consist of direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from manure nitrogen (N) added to agricultural soils by farmers. Specifically, N2O is produced by microbial processes of nitrification and de-nitrification taking place on the application site (direct emissions), and after volatilization/re-deposition and leaching processes (indirect emissions). The FAOSTAT emissions database is computed following Tier 1 IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories vol. 4, ch. 10 and 11 (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol4.html). GHG emissions are provided as direct, indirect and total by country, regions and special groups, with global coverage, relative to the period 1961-present (with annual updates) and with projections for 2030 and 2050, expressed as Gg N2O and Gg CO2eq, by livestock species (asses, buffaloes, camels, cattle (dairy and non-dairy), chickens (broilers and layers), ducks, goats, horses, llamas, mules, sheep, swine (breeding and market) and turkeys) and by species aggregates (all animals, camels and llamas, cattle, chickens, mules and asses, poultry birds, sheep and goats, swine). Implied emission factor for N2O and activity data (N content in manure) are also provided."
GV,Emissions - Agriculture: Cultivation of Organic Soils,"The domain Cultivation of Organic soils contains nitrous oxide (N2O) gas emissions from organic soils under cropland (item: Cropland organic soils) and grassland (item: Grassland organic soils).  The FAOSTAT emissions database is computed following Tier 1 IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol4.html) applied to geospatial data. GHG emissions are provided by country, region and special groups, with global coverage, relative to the period 1990-2016 (with annual updates) and with projections for 2030 and 2050, expressed both as Gg N2O and Gg CO2eq, by cropland, grassland and by their aggregation. Implied emission factor for N2O as well activity data (areas) are also provided."
GY,Emissions - Agriculture: Synthetic Fertilizers,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from synthetic fertilizers consist of nitrous oxide gas from synthetic nitrogen additions to managed soils. Specifically, N2O is produced by microbial processes of nitrification and de-nitrification taking place on the addition site (direct emissions), and after volatilization/re-deposition and leaching processes (indirect emissions).  The FAOSTAT emissions database is computed following Tier 1 IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories vol. 4, ch. 11 (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol4.html). GHG emissions are provided as direct, indirect and total by country, regions and special groups, with global coverage, relative to the period 1961-present (with annual updates) and with projections for 2030 and 2050, expressed as Gg N2O and Gg CO2eq. Implied emission factor for N2O and activity data (consumption) are also provided."
IC,Investment: Credit to Agriculture,"The Credit to Agriculture dataset provides national data for over 100 countries on the amount of loans provided by the private/commercial banking sector to producers in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, including household producers, cooperatives, and agro-businesses. For some countries, the three subsectors of agriculture, forestry, and fishing are completely specified. In other cases, complete disaggregations are not available. The dataset also provides statistics on the total credit to all industries, indicators on the share of credit to agricultural producers, and an agriculture orientation index (the agriculture share of credit, over the agriculture share of GDP)."
IG,Investment: Government Expenditure,"The Statistics Division of FAO collects annually data on Government Expenditure on Agriculture through a questionnaire, which was developed in partnership with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF is the responsible institution for the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) methodology and annually collects GFS data, including Expenditure by Functions of Government (COFOG). The Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) is an international classification developed by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and published by the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD), with the aim of categorise governments' functions according to their purposes. The FAO questionnaire aligns with Table 7 of the IMF GFS questionnaire, replicates the relevant aggregates and drills down to request additional detail related to Agriculture. The FAO dataset consists of a time series, from 2001 onwards, of Total Government Expenditure and expenditure in: Economic affairs; Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, along with its three disaggregated subsectors of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing; and Environmental Protection. In addition, expenditure in each detailed function are further disaggregated into Recurrent and Capital expenditure. Additional indicators include the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure, and the Agriculture Orientation Index (ratio between the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture Value Added as Share of GDP). Though the goal is to have complete and consistent coverage for all countries, different stages of implementation of the GFS methodology and COFOG classification, and differences in the data collection and reporting at country level creates some challenges in providing a complete and consistent global dataset."
LC,Agri-Environmental Indicators: Land Cover,The FAOSTAT domain Land Cover under the Agri-Environmental Indicators section contains land cover information organized by the land cover classes of the international standard system for Environmental and Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA CF). The land cover information is compiled from publicly available Global Land Cover (GLC) maps: a) the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP)-MODIS land cover type (20012012) and the European Spatial Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) annual land cover maps (19922015) produced by the Université catholique de Louvain (UCL)-Geomatics.
MK,Macro-Statistics: Macro Indicators,"TheFAOSTAT Macro Indicatorsdatabase provides a selection of country-level macroeconomic indicators relating to total economy (TE); agriculture (Ag); agriculture, forestry and fishing (AFF); manufacturing (MAN); manufacturing of food products and beverages (FB); manufacturing of tobacco products (Tob); and manufacturing of food, beverage and tobacco products (FBT). It releases time series for a selection of National Accounts variables, including gross domestic product, gross fixed capital formation, industry-level value added and gross output. The database also proposes additional indicators such as per capita GDP, year-on-year growth rates and measures ofindustry contribution to GDP.  All data relating to TE, AFF, and to MAN originates from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates database, which consists of a complete and consistent set of time series of the main National Accounts (NA) aggregates of all UN Members States and other territories in the world for which National Accounts information is available. The UNSD database's content is based on the countries' official NA data reported to UNSD through the annual National Accounts Questionnaire, supplemented with data estimates for any years and countries with incomplete or inconsistent information (Seehttp://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Introduction.asp).  Series relating to the sub-industry Ag are obtained from the OECD Annual National Accounts and UNSD NA Official Country Data databases while serieson the FBT industry originates - in order of priority - from OECD Annual National Accounts and UNIDO INDSTAT2 databases. In order to ensure that sub-industry series are consistent in levels with National Accounts based series, which is needed to support comparability across industries (agriculture vs. agro-industry and sub-industries), we proceed to a rescaling exercise of UNIDO originating series on UNSD National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates data series (See Section 20 for a more detailed description of the data processing steps)"
OE,Inputs: Employment Indicators,"The FAOSTAT Employment indicators module contains data on:- Agriculture value added per worker;- Employment in agriculture (absolute numbers and shares, by sex);- Share of Employees in agriculture (by sex);- Labour force participation in rural areas (by sex);- Employment-to-population ratio in rural areas (by sex).The series consist of data taken from Labour Force Surveys as available from the original sources, namely the International Labour Organization (ILO)."
PD,Prices: Deflators,"The FAOSTAT Deflators database provides the following selection of implicit price deflator series by country: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) deflator, Agriculture, Forestry, Fishery Value-Added (VA_AFF) deflator, andManufacturing Valued-Added (VA_MAN) deflator.  A deflator is a figure expressing the change in prices over a period of time for a product or a basket of products by comparing a reference period to a base period. It is obtained by dividing a current price value of a given aggregate by its real counterpart. When calculated from the major national accounting aggregates such as GDP or agriculture VA, implicit price deflators pertains to wider ranges of goods and services in the economy than that represented by any of the individual price indexes (such as CPIs, PPIs). Movements in an implicit price deflator reflect both changes in price and changes in the composition of the aggregate for which the deflator is calculated.  In the FAOSTAT Deflators database, all series are derived from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates database (UNSD NAE). In particular, the implicit GDP deflator, the implicit GFCF deflator and the implicit value added deflator in Agriculture, Forestry, Fishery are obtained by dividing the series in current prices by those in constant 2010 prices (base year)."
PE,Prices: Exchange rates - Annual,"Annual exchange rates, national currency units per U.S. dollar."
PI,Prices: Producer Price Indices - Annual,"Indices of agricultural producer prices that measure the average annual change over time in the selling prices received by farmers (prices at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale). Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The three categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Single-item price indices, Commodity group indices and the Agriculture producer price index."
PP,Prices: Producer Prices - Annual,"This sub-domain contains data on Agriculture Producer Prices. These are prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate). Annual data are provided from 1991 for over 160 countries and about 200 commodities."
QA,Production: Live Animals,"The dataset contains the following commodities and commodity aggregates thereof : Animals live n.e.s.; Asses; Beehives; Buffaloes; Camelids, other; Camels; Cattle; Chickens; Ducks; Geese and guinea fowls; Goats; Horses; Mules; Pigeons, other birds; Pigs; Rabbits and hares; Rodents, other; Sheep; Turkeys."
QC,Production: Crops,"Crop statistics are recorded for 173 products, covering the following categories: Crops Primary, Fibre Crops Primary, Cereals, Coarse Grain, Citrus Fruit, Fruit, Jute  Jute-like Fibres, Oilcakes Equivalent, Oil crops Primary, Pulses, Roots and Tubers, Treenuts and Vegetables and Melons. Data are expressed in terms of area harvested, production quantity and yield. The objective is to comprehensively cover production of all primary crops for all countries and regions in the world.Cereals: Area and production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed or silage or used for grazing are therefore excluded. Area data relate to harvested area. Some countries report sown or cultivated area only; however, in these countries the sown or cultivated area does not differ significantly in normal years from the area actually harvested, either because practically the whole area sown is harvested or because the area surveys are conducted around the harvest period.Vegetables, total (including melons): Data relate to vegetable crops grown mainly for human consumption. Crops such as cabbages, pumpkins and carrots, when explicitly cultivated for animal feed, are therefore excluded. Statistics on vegetables are not available in many countries, and the coverage of the reported data differs from country to country. In general, it appears that the data refer to crops grown in field and market gardens mainly for sale, thus excluding crops cultivated in kitchen gardens or small family gardens mainly for household consumption.Fruit, total (excluding melons): Data refer to total production of fresh fruit, whether finally used for direct consumption for food or feed, or processed into different products: dry fruit, juice, jam, alcohol, etc. Generally, production data relate to plantation crops or orchard crops grown mainly for sale. Data on production from scattered trees used mainly for home consumption are not usually collected. Production from wild plants, particularly berries, which is of some importance in certain countries, is generally disregarded by national statistical services. Therefore, the data for the various fruits and berries are rather incomplete. Bananas and plantains: Figures on bananas refer, as far as possible, to all edible fruit-bearing species of the genus Musa except Musa paradisiaca, commonly known as plantain. Unfortunately, several countries make no distinction in their statistics between bananas and plantains and publish only overall estimates. When this occurs and there is some indication or assumption that the data reported refer mainly to bananas, the data are included. The production data on bananas and plantains reported by the various countries are also difficult to compare because a number of countries report in terms of bunches, which generally means that the stalk is included in the weight. Dates, plantains and total grapes are included in the total fruit aggregated figures, while olives are excluded.        Treenuts, aggregated: Production of nuts (including chestnuts) relates to nuts in the shell or in the husk. Statistics are very scanty and generally refer only to crops for sale. In addition to the kind of nuts shown separately, production data include all other treenuts mainly used as dessert or table nuts, such as pecan nuts, pili nuts, sapucaia nuts and macadamia nuts. Nuts mainly used for flavouring beverages are excludedas are masticatory and stimulant nuts and nuts used mainly for the extraction of oil or butter, including areca/betel nuts, cola nuts, illipe nuts, karate nuts, coconuts, tung nuts, oilpalm nuts etc."

All data shown relate to total meat production, that is, from both commercial and farm slaughter. Data are given in terms of dressed carcass weight, excluding offal and slaughter fats. Production of beef and buffalo meat includes veal; mutton and goat meat includes meat from lambs and kids; pig meat includes bacon and ham in fresh equivalent. Poultry meat includes meat from all domestic birds and refers, wherever possible, to ready-to-cook weight. Data on poultry-meat production reported by national statistical offices could be expressed in terms of either live weight, eviscerated weight, ready-to-cook weight or dressed weight. Data for countries reporting in other than ready-to-cook weight have been converted into the ready-to-cook equivalent.Milk: Data on milk production relate to total production of whole fresh milk, excluding the milk sucked by young animals but including amounts fed to livestock. Eggs: Some countries have no statistics on egg production, and estimates had to be derived from such related data as chicken or total poultry numbers and reported or assumed rates of egg laying. Most of the countries that have statistics on egg production report either the total weight of eggs or the numbers of eggs produced. Data generally refer to total production, including eggs for hatching, in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors.Wool: Wool production statistics are generally given for greasy wool, which contains from 30 to 65 percent impurities. In order to make figures comparable, data are also given on a degreased (scoured) basis.Honey: Production data should cover the amount sold by beekeepers plus other recorded collection of honey. The data presented in the table are incomplete, particularly with regard to African and Asian countries."

RT,Inputs: Pesticides Trade,"This domain contains data on pesticides and covers two different categories: pesticides traded in form or packagingfor retail sale or as preparations or articles, and pesticides traded as separate chemically defined compounds (if relevant for the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade). The pesticides traded for retail sale or as preparations or articles are those classified under code 38.08 in the Harmonized System Nomenclature (HS) and include: hazardous pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, disinfectants and other. For these pesticides, this domain contains trade data (imports and exports) in values only (current 1000 US dollars), and the time series extends from 1961 onwards. The pesticides traded as separate chemically defined compounds are those listed in Annex III of the Rotterdam Convention (excluding industrial chemicals) and therefore subject to the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure. The correspondence with the HS Nomenclature is shown in the table  at the Related Documents section. For these pesticides, this domain contains trade data (imports and exports) in both value (current 1000 US dollars) and quantity (net weight in tonnes), and the time series extends from 2007 onwards."
