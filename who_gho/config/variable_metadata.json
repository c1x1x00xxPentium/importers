  "AIR_10": "Rationale: As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the burden of disease resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air  pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these  pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human  health.\nIn high-income countries, urban outdoor air pollution ranks in the top ten risk factors to health, and is the first environmental risk factors.\n\nDefinition: The burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution can be expressed as :\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of deaths\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Death rate (both crude and age-standardized)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DALYs rate (both crude and age-standardized)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of years life lost (YLLs)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 YLLs rate (both crude and age-standardized)\nDeath (DALYs, or YLLs) rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years). Age-standardized rates adjust for differences in population age distributionby applying the observed age-specific mortality (or other health outcomes) rates for each population to a standard population. The age-standardized rates can therefore be used to compare the rates of countries without being affected by the differences in age distribution from country to country.\nEvidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to ambient air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Acute respiratory infectionsin young children (estimated under 5 years of age);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Cerebrovascular diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Ischaemic heart diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults (estimated above 25 years); and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Lung\u00a0 cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).\n\nMethod of estimation: Burden of disease is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (in this case, the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed).\nThis allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed\u00a0 to the exposure, in this case the annual mean concentration of particulate matter.\nApplying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths or DALYs), gives the total number of deaths or DALYs that results from ambient air pollution.",

The age-standardized rates can therefore be used to compare the rates of countries without being affected by the differences in age distribution from country to country.\nEvidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to ambient air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Acute respiratory infectionsin young children (estimated under 5 years of age);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Cerebrovascular diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Ischaemic heart diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults (estimated above 25 years); and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Lung\u00a0 cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).\n\nMethod of estimation: Burden of disease is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (in this case, the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed).\nThis allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed\u00a0 to the exposure, in this case the annual mean concentration of particulate matter.\nApplying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths or DALYs), gives the total number of deaths or DALYs that results from ambient air pollution.",

The full birth histories were used to estimate the probability of dying in children aged 5 to 14 (10q5) for three reference periods prior to each survey (0-3 years prior to the survey, 4-7 years, and 8-11 years). Summary birth histories collected in censuses and surveys were not included, because indirect demographic methods used to convert such data into mortality indices were originally designed to estimate mortality in children below age 5, and there has been little assessment of the performance of these indirect approaches when applied to older children\n\nMethod of estimation: The statistical model developed for under-five mortality (Bayesian B-splines bias-adjusted model \u2013 or B3 model) was used to obtain a smooth trend curve averaging over the estimates and accounting for potential outliers and biases in data series.

The live births were calculated by taking the infant population from the World Population Prospects: the 2012 revision (15) and adding back the deaths in the neonatal and post-neonatal periods while accounting for the fraction of period lived before the death.

These amounts are then averaged across all households (including those without any health expenditure) to get the overall average change in the poverty gap due to health spending.

Household consumption expenditure or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita. Household expenditure on health are defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (promotive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long term care) provided by any type of provider.

  "HIV_0000000025": "Rationale: In order to protect themselves and to prevent infecting others, it is important for individuals to know their HIV status. Knowledge of one\u2019s status is also a critical factor in the decision to seek treatment. Testing volume is useful for programme monitoring, commodity forecasting, staff resource planning and as an input into the UNAIDS model to monitor progress towards the first 90 (90% of people living with HIV know their HIV status), if required.\n\nDefinition: \u25cf\t0\u201314 years for children and 15 years and older by sex (men and women) for adults.\n\nMethod of estimation: Numerator: The reported number should be collected from HTS programme registers, log books and reporting forms. Reported data should be a count of the number of tests conducted where results were returned to a person and not the number of unique persons who tested at least once during the calendar year. Please note that only tests conducted where the results are returned to the person should be counted. Also, a person should only be counted as testing once, even if up to three different assays are performed to confirm an HIV-positive diagnosis according to the national testing algorithm.

  "HIV_0000000026": "Rationale: The number of new infections is important for monitoring both epidemic trends and dynamics within the population.\n\nDefinition: The estimated annual number new HIV infections estimated by the end of a specific year.\n\nMethod of measurement: Analysis of country data on HIV prevalence, particularly among young age groups and, where available, direct HIV incidence data; internationally consistent modelled estimates, e.g. Spectrum AIM.\n\nMethod of estimation: Modelled estimates of the number of new HIV infections are produced and compiled \u00a0by country teams and published annually by UNAIDS and WHO. Standard methods and tools for HIV estimates that are appropriate to the pattern of the HIV epidemic are used . However, to obtain the best possible estimates, judgment needs to be used as to the quality of the data and how representative it is of the population.",
  "HIV_ARTCOVERAGE": "Rationale: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been shown to reduce mortality among those infected and efforts are being made to make it more affordable within low- and middle-income countries. This indicator assesses the progress in providing antiretroviral combination therapy to all people with\u00a0 HIV infection. As the HIV epidemic matures, increasing numbers of people are reaching advanced stages of HIV infection. Over recent years WHO has issued various updates in the ARV guidelines. Under the 2013 WHO consolidated guidelines, roughly 85% people living with HIV would be eligible for treatment in 2013. For reasons of comparibility across countries and over time in the context of changing recommendations, this indicator relates to the number of people receiving ART as of proportion of the overall estimated number of people living with HIV.\u00a0 The ranges around the levels of people living with HIV who received ART are based on the uncertainty bounds around the estimates of people living with HIV.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of adults and children with HIV infection currently receiving antiretroviral combination therapy in accordance with the nationally approved treatment protocols (or WHO/UNAIDS standards) among the estimated number of adults and children with HIV infection.\nNumerator: Number of adults and children with HIV infection who are currently receiving antiretroviral combination therapy in accordance with the nationally approved treatment protocol (or WHO/UNAIDS standards) at the end of the reporting period.\nDenominator: Estimated number of adults and children with HIV infection.\n\nMethod of measurement: Numerator:\u00a0The number of adults and children with HIV infection who are currently receiving antiretroviral combination therapy can be obtained through data collected from facility-based antiretroviral therapy registers or drug supply management systems. These are then tallied and transferred to cross-sectional monthly or quarterly reports which can then be aggregated for national totals. Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in the private sector and public sector should be included in the numerator where data are available. Antiretroviral therapy taken only for the purpose of prevention of mother-to-child transmission and post-exposure prophylaxis are not included in this indicator. HIV-infected pregnant women who are eligible for antiretroviral therapy and on antiretroviral therapy for their own treatment are included in this indicator.\nDenominator: The denominator is generated by estimating the number of people with\u00a0 HIV infection. A standard modelling method is recommended. The Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)* and Spectrum*, softwares have been developed by the UNAIDS/WHO Reference Group on Estimates, Models and Projections.\n\nMethod of estimation: WHO, UNAIDS and UNICEF are responsible for reporting data for this indicator at the international level, and have been compiling country specific data since 2003.Predominant type of statistics: predicted\n\nNumerator: The data on people receiving antiretroviral therapy are collected through a joint joint international monitoring and reporting process\u00a0 with WHO, UNICEF and the UNAIDS Secretariat.\u00a0 For this purpose a joint data tool has been developed that contains Global AIDS Progress Reporting (GARPR) indicators -- before 2012 known as UNGASS indicators -- as well as as well additional WHO/UNICEF Universal Access Health Sector indicators. Data are also compiled from the most recent reports received by WHO and/or UNAIDS from health ministries or from other reliable sources in the countries, such as bilateral partners, foundations and nongovernmental organizations that are major providers of treatment services.\u00a0In order to facilitate collaboration at country level, the country offices of WHO, UNICEF and the UNAIDS Secretariat, work jointly with national counterparts and partner agencies to collate and validate data in a single collaborative consultation process.\nIn addition, at least twice a year, international data reconciliation meetings are organized to review and validate data reported to WHO, UNICEF, the UNAIDS Secretariat, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and the United States President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Where discrepancies are identified between data reported to the different organizations, follow-up letters are sent to UNAIDS, UNICEF and WHO country offices in order to liaise with national authorities to seek clarification and resolve discrepancies.\nThe estimates of antiretroviral therapy coverage presented here are calculated by dividing the estimated number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy as of December by the number of people estimated to need treatment in same year (based on UNAIDS/WHO methods).",
