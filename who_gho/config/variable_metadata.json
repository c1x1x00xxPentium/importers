  "AIR_10": "Rationale: As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the burden of disease resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air  pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these  pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human  health.\nIn high-income countries, urban outdoor air pollution ranks in the top ten risk factors to health, and is the first environmental risk factors.\n\nDefinition: The burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution can be expressed as :\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of deaths\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Death rate (both crude and age-standardized)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DALYs rate (both crude and age-standardized)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of years life lost (YLLs)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 YLLs rate (both crude and age-standardized)\nDeath (DALYs, or YLLs) rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years). Age-standardized rates adjust for differences in population age distributionby applying the observed age-specific mortality (or other health outcomes) rates for each population to a standard population. The age-standardized rates can therefore be used to compare the rates of countries without being affected by the differences in age distribution from country to country.\nEvidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to ambient air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Acute respiratory infectionsin young children (estimated under 5 years of age);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Cerebrovascular diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Ischaemic heart diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults (estimated above 25 years); and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Lung\u00a0 cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).\n\nMethod of estimation: Burden of disease is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (in this case, the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed).\nThis allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed\u00a0 to the exposure, in this case the annual mean concentration of particulate matter.\nApplying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths or DALYs), gives the total number of deaths or DALYs that results from ambient air pollution.",

Of all of these  pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human  health.\nIn high-income countries, urban outdoor air pollution ranks in the top ten risk factors to health, and is the first environmental risk factors.\n\nDefinition: The burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution can be expressed as :\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of deaths\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Death rate (both crude and age-standardized)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DALYs rate (both crude and age-standardized)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of years life lost (YLLs)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 YLLs rate (both crude and age-standardized)\nDeath (DALYs, or YLLs) rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years). Age-standardized rates adjust for differences in population age distributionby applying the observed age-specific mortality (or other health outcomes) rates for each population to a standard population. The age-standardized rates can therefore be used to compare the rates of countries without being affected by the differences in age distribution from country to country.\nEvidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to ambient air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Acute respiratory infectionsin young children (estimated under 5 years of age);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Cerebrovascular diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Ischaemic heart diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults (estimated above 25 years); and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Lung\u00a0 cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).\n\nMethod of estimation: Burden of disease is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (in this case, the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed).\nThis allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed\u00a0 to the exposure, in this case the annual mean concentration of particulate matter.\nApplying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths or DALYs), gives the total number of deaths or DALYs that results from ambient air pollution.",

The full birth histories were used to estimate the probability of dying in children aged 5 to 14 (10q5) for three reference periods prior to each survey (0-3 years prior to the survey, 4-7 years, and 8-11 years). Summary birth histories collected in censuses and surveys were not included, because indirect demographic methods used to convert such data into mortality indices were originally designed to estimate mortality in children below age 5, and there has been little assessment of the performance of these indirect approaches when applied to older children\n\nMethod of estimation: The statistical model developed for under-five mortality (Bayesian B-splines bias-adjusted model \u2013 or B3 model) was used to obtain a smooth trend curve averaging over the estimates and accounting for potential outliers and biases in data series.
