 Macro Indicators - FAO (2019),"{""dataPublishedBy"": ""Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (2019) "", ""dataPublisherSource"": ""* UNSD National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates (http://data.un.org/),* OECD Annual National Accounts (http://stats.oecd.org/) * UNIDO INDSTAT2 (https://stat.unido.org/)"", ""link"": ""http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/?#data/"", ""retrievedDate"": ""10-Jan-2020"", ""additionalInfo"": ""The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the total gross value added from all institutional units resident in the economy, at producers' prices, plus taxes on imports, less subsidies on imports, plus non-deductible VAT (Production approach to GDP). As such, GDP measures the total value created in the production of goods and services by all resident units during the accounting period. The output of most goods or services is usually recorded when their production is completed. However, when it takes a long time to produce a unit of output, it becomes necessary to recognize that output is being produced continuously and to record it as a work-in-progress. For example, the production of certain agricultural goods or large durable goods such as ships or buildings may take months or years to complete. In such cases, it would distort economic reality to treat the output as if it were all produced at the moment of time when the process of production happens to terminate. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) is measured by the total value of a producers' acquisitions, less disposals, of fixed assets during the accounting period plus certain specified expenditure on services that adds to the value of non-produced assets. The boundary line between those products that are retained in the economy and are used for consumption and those products that are used for capital formation is known as the asset boundary. The asset boundary for fixed assets consists of goods and services that are used in production for more than one year. Two exclusions from the asset boundary should be noted. The first is that consumer durables are not treated as fixed assets. The second exclusion is pragmatic rather than conceptual and concerns small tools. Hand tools such as saws, spades, knives, axes, hammers, screwdrivers and spanners or wrenches are examples. If expenditures on such tools take place at a fairly steady rate and if their value is small compared with expenditures on more complex machinery and equipment, it may be appropriate to treat the tools as materials or supplies used for intermediate consumption. In countries in which they account for a significant part of the value of the total stock of an industry's durable producers' goods, they may be treated as fixed assets and their acquisition and disposal by producers recorded under gross fixed capital formation. Gross fixed capital formation may take the form of improvements to existing fixed assets, such as buildings and structures, that increase their productive capacity, extend their service lives, or both. A different treatment is applied to improvements to land in its natural state. In this case the improvements are treated as the creation of a new fixed asset and are not regarded as giving rise to an increase in the value of the natural resource. If land, once improved, is further improved, then the normal treatment of improvements to existing fixed assets applies. The Investment Ratio (IR) is obtained as the GFCF-to-GDP ratioGross Output (GO). At the most granular level, gross output consists of those goods and services that are produced within an establishment that become available for use outside that establishment, plus any goods and services produced for own final use. Industry gross output is the market value of the goods and services produced by an industry. Value added (VA) represents the contribution of labor and capital to the production process. Gross output relates directly to the concept of value added as the latter is obtained by subtracting the value of intermediate consumption evaluated at purchasers' prices from the value of output at basic prices. Although the outputs and inputs are valued using different sets of prices, for brevity the value added is described by the prices used to value the outputs. From the point of view of the producer, purchasers' prices for inputs and basic prices for outputs represent the prices actually paid and received. Their use leads to a measure of gross value added that is particularly relevant for the producer. Net value added is defined as the value of output less the values of both intermediate consumption and consumption of fixed capital.Gross National Income (GNI) is a measure of total incomes receivable in the economy. Itis equal to GDP less primary incomes payable to non-resident units plus primary incomes receivable from non-resident units. In other words, GNI is equal to GDP less taxes (less subsidies) on production and imports, compensation of employees and property income payable to the rest of the world plus the corresponding items receivable from the rest of the world.""}",1

It is a measure of average productivity.Value added represents the contribution of labor and capital to the production process. Gross output relates directly to the concept of value added as the latter is obtained by subtracting the value of intermediate consumption evaluated at purchasers' prices from the value of output at basic prices. Although the outputs and inputs are valued using different sets of prices, for brevity the value added is described by the prices used to value the outputs. From the point of view of the producer, purchasers' prices for inputs and basic prices for outputs represent the prices actually paid and received. Their use leads to a measure of gross value added that is particularly relevant for the producer. Net value added is defined as the value of output less the values of both intermediate consumption and consumption of fixed capital.Data on the Value Added (Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing in constant 2005 USD) is derived from FAOSTAT and is then divided by the number of people employed in the agricultural sector, taken from ILOSTAT.- Employment in agriculture: This indicator corresponds to the agriculture category of the indicator called 'Employment by sex and economic activity in the ILOSTAT' for the total population. The indicator provides information on the relative importance of agriculture with regard to employment. Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a specified brief period, such as one week or one day, were in the following categories: a) paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work); or b) self-employment (whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work).The ILOSTAT presents the data by branch of economic activity on the basis of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC). The data is further disaggregated by sex. The ISIC is the international reference classification of productive activities. The classification by economic activity refers to the main activity of the establishment in which a person worked during the reference period. The branch of economic activity of a person does not depend on the specific duties or functions of the person\u2019s job, but on the characteristics of the economic unit in which this person works.- Employment in agriculture, male: This indicator corresponds to the agriculture category of the indicator called 'Employment by sex and economic activity in the ILOSTAT' for the male population.

Thus, value of production measures production in monetary terms at the farm gate level. Since intermediate uses within the agricultural sector (seed and feed) have not been subtracted from production data, this value of production aggregate refers to the notion of \""gross production\"". Value of gross production is provided in both current and constant terms and is expressed in US dollars and Standard Local Currency (SLC). The current value of production measures value in the prices relating to the period being measured. Thus, it represents the market value of food and agricultural products at the time they were produced. Knowing this figure is helpful in understanding exactly what was happening within a given economy at that point in time. Often, this information can help explain economic trends that emerged in later periods and why they took place. Value of production in constant terms is derived using the average prices of a selected year or years, known as the base period. Constant price series can be used to show how the quantity or volume of products has changed, and are often referred to as volume measures. The ratio of the current and constant price series gives a measure of price movements. US dollar figures for value of gross production are converted from local currencies using official exchange rates as prevailing in the respective years. The SLC of a country is the local currency prevailing in the latest year. Expressing data series in one uniform currency is useful because it avoids the influence of revaluation in local currency, if any, on value of production.

They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed. All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006. Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them. Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities. They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages. It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and non-food production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group \u201ccrops\u201d and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group \u201clivestock products\u201d. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed. The \""international commodity prices\u201d are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These\u201d international prices\u201d, expressed in so-called \""international dollars\u201d, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single \u201cprice\u201d to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published. The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country. Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients. Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value. Indices for meat production are computed based on data for production from indigenous animals, which takes account of the meat equivalent of exported live animals but excludes the meat equivalent of imported live animals. For index purposes, annual changes in livestock and poultry numbers or in their average live weight are not taken into account. The indices are calculated from production data presented on a calendar year basis. The FAO indices may differ from those produced by the countries themselves because of differences in concepts of production, coverage, weights, time reference of data and methods of calculation.""}",46

Fixed assets are produced assets that are used repeatedly or continuously in production processes for more than one year. They are divided into tangible fixed assets and intangible fixed assets. Examples of tangible produced fixed-assets are dwellings, non-residential buildings and structures (e.g. barns, warehouse, factories, major land improvements\u2026), machinery and equipment, and cultivated assets. Examples of intangible fixed assets are mineral exploration, computer software, research and development and entertainment. Given the focus of the present FAO database on the agriculture, forestry and fishing industry, the following words of caution are of order: -An important element from the SNA definition of non-financial assets considered for capital stock calculation is that non-produced assets are excluded from the fixed assets boundary. Non-produced assets that occur in nature include natural resources, subsoil assets, non-cultivated biological resources and water resources. Other non-produced assets are licenses and marketing assets (including goodwill). That is, only land improvements and cultivated biological resources are part of the fixed capital base. -Cultivated biological resources cover animal resources yielding repeat products as well as tree, crop and plant resources yielding repeat products whose natural growth and regeneration is under the direct control, responsibility and management of institutional units. Examples of animal resources are breeding stocks, dairy cattle, draft animals, sheep used for wool production and animals used for transportation, racing or entertainment. Animals raised for slaughter, including poultry, are not fixed assets but inventories. Examples of tree, crop and plant resources are trees (including vines and shrubs) cultivated for fruits and nuts, for sap and resin and for bark and leaf products. Some examples of GFCF:oSheep used in the production of wool;oBull (male cow) used for breeding;oChickens used to produce eggs;oA vine tree used to produce grapes for wine.Chickens for slaughter and sheep used for meat are not part of GFCF but of inventories. Agriculture Investment Ratio indicates to what proportion of the industry-wide value added do the aggregate spending on gross fixed capital formation amount. This indicator is obtained as the share of GFCF in agriculture, forestry and fishing over Value Added in agriculture, forestry and fishing. Gross Fixed Capital Formation Agriculture Orientation Index indicates how the investment ratio in agriculture, forestry, and fishery compares to that of the total economy.

The sources for these data are: \u2022 FAOSTAT emissions domains (Emissions - Agriculture and Emissions - Land Use) (FAO, 2016) for the sectors: \u2018Agriculture total\u2019, \u2018Land Use sources\u2019 and \u2018Forest\u2019. \u2022 EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) (JRC/PBL, 2016) for the sectors: \u2018Energy (energy industries, manufacturing and fugitive emissions)\u2019, \u2018Transport\u2019, \u2018Residential, commercial, institutional and AFF (Agriculture/Forestry/Fishing)\u2019, \u2018Industrial processes and product use\u2019, \u2018Waste\u2019, \u2018Other sources\u2019 and \u2018International Bunkers\u2019. In the EDGAR database, developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission and the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (JRC/PBL, 2016), the annual data on GHG emissions are available by country, source/sink category, gas and year. The source/sink categories follow the guidelines from IPCC (1997) Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories (Olivier et al., 2011, p.8). In this FAOSTAT \u2018Emissions by sector\u2019 domain, the source/sink categories from EDGAR have been aggregated into seven sectors, as shown in table 1 below. EDGAR data under IPCC categories 4 and 5 (\u2018Total Agriculture\u2019 and \u2018Total Land-Use Change and Forestry\u2019) have not been included, as these data have been taken from FAOSTAT. EDGAR data for \u2018International aviation\u2019 and \u2018International navigation/shipping\u2019 are available only at the world level."", ""link"": ""http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/?#data/"", ""retrievedDate"": ""10-Jan-2020"", ""additionalInfo"": ""Emissions are displayed for all GHG aggregated, and also separately for: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and F-gases.

Using these data and the available information on seed rates, waste coefficients, stock changes and types of utilization (feed, food, processing and other utilization), a supply/utilization account is prepared for each commodity in weight terms. The food component of the commodity account, which is usually derived as a balancing item, refers to the total amount of the commodity available for human consumption during the year. Besides commodity-by-commodity information, the FAO FBS also provide total food availability estimates by aggregating the food component of all commodities including fishery products. From these values and the available population estimates, the per person dietary energy and protein and fat supplies are derived and expressed on a daily basis. In the FBS production data refer only to primary products while data for all other elements also include processed products derived there from, expressed in primary commodity equivalent.""}",78
