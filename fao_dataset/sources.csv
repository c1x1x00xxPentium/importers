It is a measure of average productivity.Value added represents the contribution of labor and capital to the production process. Gross output relates directly to the concept of value added as the latter is obtained by subtracting the value of intermediate consumption evaluated at purchasers' prices from the value of output at basic prices. Although the outputs and inputs are valued using different sets of prices, for brevity the value added is described by the prices used to value the outputs. From the point of view of the producer, purchasers' prices for inputs and basic prices for outputs represent the prices actually paid and received. Their use leads to a measure of gross value added that is particularly relevant for the producer. Net value added is defined as the value of output less the values of both intermediate consumption and consumption of fixed capital.Data on the Value Added (Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing in constant 2005 USD) is derived from FAOSTAT and is then divided by the number of people employed in the agricultural sector, taken from ILOSTAT.- Employment in agriculture: This indicator corresponds to the agriculture category of the indicator called 'Employment by sex and economic activity in the ILOSTAT' for the total population. The indicator provides information on the relative importance of agriculture with regard to employment. Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a specified brief period, such as one week or one day, were in the following categories: a) paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work); or b) self-employment (whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work).The ILOSTAT presents the data by branch of economic activity on the basis of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC). The data is further disaggregated by sex. The ISIC is the international reference classification of productive activities. The classification by economic activity refers to the main activity of the establishment in which a person worked during the reference period. The branch of economic activity of a person does not depend on the specific duties or functions of the person\u2019s job, but on the characteristics of the economic unit in which this person works.- Employment in agriculture, male: This indicator corresponds to the agriculture category of the indicator called 'Employment by sex and economic activity in the ILOSTAT' for the male population. The indicator provides information on the relative importance of agriculture with regard to employment.

They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed. All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006. Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them. Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities. They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages. It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and non-food production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group \u201ccrops\u201d and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group \u201clivestock products\u201d. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed. The \""international commodity prices\u201d are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These\u201d international prices\u201d, expressed in so-called \""international dollars\u201d, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single \u201cprice\u201d to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published. The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country. Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients. Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value. Indices for meat production are computed based on data for production from indigenous animals, which takes account of the meat equivalent of exported live animals but excludes the meat equivalent of imported live animals. For index purposes, annual changes in livestock and poultry numbers or in their average live weight are not taken into account. The indices are calculated from production data presented on a calendar year basis. The FAO indices may differ from those produced by the countries themselves because of differences in concepts of production, coverage, weights, time reference of data and methods of calculation.""}",49
